# Crowdfunding Product Page

This web-app is a good showcase of modern looking crowdfunding page. 
It's also a good practice of implementing and using Javascript for manipulation of structure and style of webpage.

You can clone and run this app on your local machine. For best experience it's best to have installed  Node.js with npm packages like json-server and live-server.

Enjoy!
